# Project-2-BillY
BillY is an app where you have access to all your tickets, bills and fines. Upon authorization user has access to bills and will be able to make a payment upon clicking "payment" button. User has access to payments history information, as well as overdue payments. 

Too often, life gets busy and it becomes harder to keep track of what you owe. People move from place to place, switch utility companies, banks, credit cards, insurance, etc. Do you have to pay for another month of internet from one company after switching to another company? What if youâ€™ve moved in the middle of the month before rent is do? With BillY, users can see what companies are charging them and be notified of conflicts before their bills become past due.

Information about user and bill information will be stored in a SQL database. This web application uses  express to communicate within an MVC model, setting up routes between the a user and multiple bills that belong to them. HTML was initially used to set up front end portions of the application but in order to make the user interface cleaner, handlebars.js was used in the design. User authentication through passport.js was applied in order to ensure instances for each user profile and to ensure that users would only be able to access their personal account. In order to ensure security of user passcodes when authenticating an individual user, bcrypt was used to hash passcodes into an encrypted string.
